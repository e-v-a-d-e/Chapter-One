[1]   Where I Belong    

[1] Log line: A raid by the notorious sMars purist, Leo Frobenius   
“After all my planet has done for this dead-lands!  How dare they deny us the stratosphere?!”    

Returning to Mawrth Vallis to find the colonies in a dogfight with Earth’s conglomerates, Oja sheepishly joins in the conflict.  Led by Ch’kumah Nzeog, the Obgis’ Defiance Defense laid out a bushwhack reconnaissance attack on the United Earth Federals conducting terra-formation nuking outside of Tarsis.  The UEF troops have already taken massive losses in the armbush crippling the entire nuking operations.  They are forced to fall back.    

Oja and Ch’kumah Nzeog meet with the local deep learners, t’Fawa Blewa and their soothsayer who regret their actions but insist it was necessary to save their planet.  The reinforced UEF lay an onslaught with aerial and ground tactical forces. The Obgis were no match power-to-power with UEF siege led by Captain Inua Wushi. Nzeog is lost in the fight. generative synthetic intelligence is digitally euthanized in Oja's arm not before she reveals to him the bio-mech revolution ongoing underground.
